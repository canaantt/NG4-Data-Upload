# Oncoscape User Data Uploading Tool Use Cases

##### Oncoscape's Data Portal uses Google’s Authentication Service, a secure mechanism for managing accounts, so that users do not need a separate login and password for their datasets. Your name and Google email address will be the only personal information from your Google account that will be shared with Oncoscape. At login, Google provides the Data Portal a randomly generated code that verifies your identity within the system.
